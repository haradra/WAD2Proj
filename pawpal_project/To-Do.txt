Things to do:

The register form is not working. It says something about a profile picture.

Ratings

Think about Pet owner field, is there an association?

Google Maps Location

Messenger

Matching (both backend link fields and front end)

Think about what to add to home page.

Connect pop script fields like description etc to user profile

Fix Github

Add footer content

Unit Testing

Make website responsive (I guess we can't set the certain width in the css. [I'm not 100% sure though])

Missing "favicon.ico"?
    Not Found: /favicon.ico


EditAccount: edit profile picture, location, address etc.

Registration: showpets checkbox - currently user has to tick it, but it shouldn't be needed for him to be able to register
After registration, user should be logged in

When changing either first name or last name and leaving the other field blank, it changes that name to blank

Experience - we can currently select also negative value. Needs to be corrected

When incorrect login details are typed we need to be redirected somewhere, instead of seeing new page etc.
