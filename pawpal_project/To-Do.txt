---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frontend

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make website responsive - it's done; only check for new additions

Think about what to add to home page.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Backend

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Experience - we can currently select also negative value. Needs to be corrected

When incorrect login details are typed we need to be redirected somewhere, instead of seeing new page etc.

When changing either first name or last name and leaving the other field blank, it changes that name to blank

Registration: showpets checkbox - currently user has to tick it, but it shouldn't be needed for him to be able to register

Unit Testing

Connect pop script fields like description etc to user profile

Fix Github - will be fixed when deployed on pythonanywhere

Rating - backend only
