Things to do:

Rating - backend only

Google Maps Location - Milo (in process)

Matching (both backend link fields and front end) - not required

Think about what to add to home page.

Connect pop script fields like description etc to user profile

Fix Github - will be fixed when deployed on pythonanywhere

Unit Testing

Make website responsive (I guess we can't set the certain width in the css. [I'm not 100% sure though])

Registration: showpets checkbox - currently user has to tick it, but it shouldn't be needed for him to be able to register

After registration, user should be logged in - are you sure? Is this a required? -milo

When changing either first name or last name and leaving the other field blank, it changes that name to blank

Experience - we can currently select also negative value. Needs to be corrected

When incorrect login details are typed we need to be redirected somewhere, instead of seeing new page etc.

Upload to python anywhere
